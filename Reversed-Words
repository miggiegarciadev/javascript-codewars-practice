// INSTRUCTIONS: 
//Complete the solution so that it reverses all of the words within the string passed in.
//Words are separated by exactly one space and there are no leading or trailing spaces.
//Example(Input --> Output):
//"The greatest victory is that which requires no battle" --> "battle no requires which that is victory greatest The"


//MY SOLUTION: 
function reverseWords(str) {
  // Use the split() method to break the input string into an array of words
  // The separator for the words is " " (a space)
  let words = str.split(" ");
  
  // Use the reverse() method to reverse the order of the elements within the array
  words.reverse();
  
  // Use the join() method to join the words together again into a single string
  // The separator for the words is " " (a space)
  return words.join(" ");
}
console.log(reverseWords("The greatest victory is that which requires no battle"));


// SAMPLE TESTING: 
//const { assert } = require('chai');

//describe("reverseWords",function(){
//  it("should work for some examples", function(){
//    assert.strictEqual(reverseWords("hello world!"                 ),  "world! hello")
//    assert.strictEqual(reverseWords("yoda doesn't speak like this" ),  "this like speak doesn't yoda")
//    assert.strictEqual(reverseWords("foobar"                       ),  "foobar")
//    assert.strictEqual(reverseWords("kata editor"                  ),  "editor kata")
//    assert.strictEqual(reverseWords("row row row your boat"        ),  "boat your row row row")
//    assert.strictEqual(reverseWords(""                             ),  "")
//  });
//  });
