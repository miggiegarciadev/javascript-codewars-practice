// INSTRUCTIONS: 
Note: This kata is inspired by Convert a Number to a String!. Try that one too.

Description
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

Examples
"1234" --> 1234
"605"  --> 605
"1405" --> 1405
 

//MY SOLUTION: 
- this area is your solution withinline comments 



// SAMPLE TESTING: 
const Test = require('@codewars/test-compat');

describe( "stringToNumber", function(){
  it( "should work for the examples" , function(){
    Test.assertEquals(stringToNumber("1234"),1234)
    Test.assertEquals(stringToNumber("605"), 605)
    Test.assertEquals(stringToNumber("1405"),1405)
    Test.assertEquals(stringToNumber("-7"),  -7)
  });
});
